# Rehearsal Web Application

This project is a web application that allows users to log in from their phones and register as musicians, specifying their instrument. An admin user can create a rehearsal session, during which all participants can connect and view the song's chords and lyrics.

## Features

- User authentication for musicians.
- Admin controls for managing rehearsal sessions.
- Song selection and display based on user type (chords for musicians, lyrics for singers).
- Search functionality for songs in English or Hebrew.
